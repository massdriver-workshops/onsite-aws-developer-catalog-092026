# Massdriver Catalog

A bootstrap catalog for self-hosted Massdriver instances containing resource types, infrastructure bundles, and cloud credentials. This catalog helps you quickly model your platform architecture and developer experience before implementing infrastructure code.

**This is your platform foundation.** While this guide walks you through the concepts, you're not just following a tutorial—you're building your actual platform. This repository will serve as your platform team's source of truth for resource types and bundles. Design your infrastructure architecture, iterate on the developer experience, and refine your abstractions here—then fill in your OpenTofu/Terraform implementation when you're ready.

> [!NOTE]
> **Massdriver v2:** This catalog targets Massdriver v2 (Mass CLI ≥ `2.0.0`, GraphQL `/v2/`). v2 renamed several core concepts:
> - `targets` → **environments**
> - `packages` → **instances**
> - `artifact definitions` → **resource types**
> - `artifacts` → **resources**

**tl;dr:** [Jump to Quick Start](#customizing-your-catalog)

## Quick Start Workflow

This catalog is yours to customize and extend. Here's the recommended workflow:

1. **Clone this repository** to your organization (keep it private—it will contain your infrastructure code)
2. **Configure GitHub Secrets** (see [Quick Start](#quick-start)) to enable automatic publishing on push to `main`
3. **Start experimenting** with bundles in your editor—edit schemas, add parameters, define dependencies
4. **Watch the developer experience get built** in real-time in Massdriver as you iterate on your abstractions

The beauty of this approach: you can refine the entire developer experience—what parameters developers see, how bundles connect, what resources are produced—all before writing a single line of infrastructure code.

## Key Concepts

If you're new to Massdriver, here are the core concepts you'll encounter:

- **Bundle**: A reusable, versioned definition of infrastructure or application components. Bundles encapsulate your IaC code (Terraform/OpenTofu/Helm), configuration schemas, dependencies, and policies into a single deployable unit. Think of them as "infrastructure packages" with built-in guardrails.

- **Resource Type** (formerly *artifact definition*): A JSON Schema contract that defines how infrastructure components can connect to each other. Resource types ensure type safety—you can't connect incompatible components.

- **Resource** (formerly *artifact*): A live, materialized resource type emitted by a deployed bundle. For example, when you deploy a PostgreSQL bundle, it emits a PostgreSQL resource containing connection details that other bundles can consume.

- **Parameters (params)**: User-configurable inputs for a bundle, like instance sizes, database names, or feature flags. These define what developers can customize when deploying infrastructure.

- **Dependency** (the `dependencies:` key in `massdriver.yaml`): Inputs a bundle needs from other bundles. When a bundle declares a dependency on a `virtual-network` resource, you must link it to a bundle that produces a virtual-network resource.

- **Project**: A logical grouping of related infrastructure, like "ecommerce-platform" or "data-pipeline". Projects contain one or more environments.

- **Environment** (formerly *target*): A deployment context within a project, like "development", "staging", or "production". Each environment has its own canvas where you design and deploy infrastructure.

- **Canvas**: The visual diagram in the Massdriver UI where you add bundles, connect them together, and configure parameters. It's your infrastructure design board.

- **Instance** (formerly *package*): A configured deployment of a bundle in a specific environment. When you add a bundle to your canvas and configure it, you're creating an instance. Think of it like the relationship between a class and an object in programming—bundles are the reusable definitions, instances are the deployed objects.

## What's Inside

### 📁 `resource-types/`

**Resource types** (formerly called *artifact definitions*) are schema-based contracts that define how infrastructure components can interact with each other in Massdriver. Think of them as type definitions for your infrastructure—they ensure that when you connect a database to an application, both sides speak the same language.

Each resource type is a directory containing a `massdriver.yaml` file:

```
resource-types/
├── virtual-network/
│   └── massdriver.yaml    # Network/VPC contract
├── postgres-database/
│   └── massdriver.yaml    # PostgreSQL connection contract
├── mysql-database/
│   └── massdriver.yaml    # MySQL connection contract
├── object-storage/
│   └── massdriver.yaml    # Object storage contract
└── workload/
    └── massdriver.yaml    # Workload metadata contract
```

> **💡 Note on Sensitive Fields**: Resource types support the [`$md.sensitive`](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/json-schema-cheat-sheet/massdriver-annotations#mdsensitive) annotation to mark fields containing credentials, passwords, or other secrets. Fields marked as sensitive are automatically masked as `[SENSITIVE]` in GraphQL queries and UI displays while remaining accessible for actual infrastructure connections. All resource data is encrypted at rest and in transit, and downloads of sensitive data are tracked in audit logs.

**⚠️ These are examples to get you started.** Edit these schemas to match your organization's infrastructure patterns and the data your bundles need to exchange. The field names, structure, and validation rules should reflect what your actual OpenTofu/Terraform code produces and consumes.

**Why they matter**: Resource types enable type-safe infrastructure composition. You can't accidentally connect a PostgreSQL resource to a bundle expecting MySQL—the system validates compatibility at design time, before any infrastructure is deployed.

Use these example resource types to:

- Define the contract between your IaC modules (what data gets passed from one to another)
- Model how services connect together in your architecture
- Design your project and environment structure
- Plan the developer experience before writing infrastructure code
- **Then customize them** to match your organization's specific needs

### 📁 `bundles/`

**Bundles** are reusable, versioned definitions of cloud infrastructure or application components. A bundle encapsulates everything needed to provision and manage a piece of infrastructure: the IaC code, configuration schemas, dependencies, outputs, and policies.

Bundles provide a safe self-service framework where you (the platform team) encode best practices into ready-to-use modules, and developers get a simple interface to deploy what they need.

This catalog includes template bundles with complete schemas and placeholder infrastructure code:

- `network/` - Network/VPC provisioning
- `postgres/` - PostgreSQL database provisioning
- `mysql/` - MySQL database provisioning
- `bucket/` - Object storage bucket provisioning
- `application/` - Application deployment template

Each bundle includes:

- ✅ Complete `massdriver.yaml` configuration
- ✅ **Parameter schemas** - Define your IaC variables (tfvars, Helm values) and customize the UI form for user configuration (instance sizes, database names, etc.)
- ✅ **Dependencies** (the `dependencies:` key) - Declare the resources from other bundles this one needs, enabling secure access to their details during automation.
- ✅ **Resources** (the `resources:` key) - Declare what infrastructure this bundle produces for others to consume.
- ✅ **UI schemas** - Control how the configuration form looks and behaves
- 🚧 Placeholder OpenTofu/Terraform code (replace with yours)

These bundles let you model first, implement later. Use the schemas to plan your architecture and test the developer experience in the Massdriver UI, then fill in the actual infrastructure code when you're ready.

For more details, see the [Bundle YAML Spec](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/guides/bundle-yaml-spec) and [Module Patterns](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/guides/module-patterns) guides.

### 📁 `templates/`

**Bundle templates** are starter scaffolds for creating new bundles. Use them with the Massdriver CLI to quickly bootstrap new infrastructure modules with the correct structure and boilerplate.

Available templates:

| Template | Provisioner | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `opentofu` | OpenTofu | OpenTofu module template |
| `terraform` | Terraform | Terraform module template |
| `bicep` | Bicep | Azure Bicep template |
| `helm-chart` | Helm | Deploy external Helm charts |

**Usage with the CLI:**

```bash
# Set custom template path (optional - for local development)
export MD_TEMPLATES_PATH=/path/to/massdriver-catalog/templates

# Create a new bundle from a template
mass bundle new --name my-bundle --template-name opentofu
```

Each template includes:
- `massdriver.yaml` - Pre-configured with example params, dependencies, and resources
- `operator.md` - Runbook template for operational guidance
- `icon.svg` - Placeholder icon
- `src/` or `chart/` - IaC boilerplate for the specific provisioner

For more details, see the [Bundle Templates](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/bundle-development/publishing/bundle-templates) guide.

### 📁 `platforms/`

**Platform integrations** are resource types that model the credentials Massdriver uses to connect to your cloud providers and infrastructure platforms. They live in their own directory (rather than under `resource-types/`) for discoverability — operationally they're published with `mass resource-type publish`, just like everything in `resource-types/`. Each platform directory contains everything needed to authenticate and interact with that platform.

> [!TIP]
> **Customize these to match how *you* authenticate.** The platform schemas shipped here are a starting point, not a prescription. If your team authenticates AWS with static access keys instead of an assumed IAM role, replace `aws/massdriver.yaml`'s schema with the fields your `aws` provider block actually consumes. If you front Azure with a managed identity, GCP with workload identity federation, or Kubernetes with an OIDC token, model that here. The fields in `schema:` should mirror the inputs to your IaC tool's provider configuration (Terraform/OpenTofu provider blocks, Helm `kubeconfig`, etc.) — Massdriver collects those values and hands them to your bundles at deploy time. Update `instructions/` with your team's onboarding steps so developers know what to paste where.

Massdriver can orchestrate any platform your IaC tooling supports. Adding a new platform (Snowflake, Datadog, Confluent Cloud, etc.) is as simple as defining its credential schema.

**Structure**:

```
platforms/aws/
├── massdriver.yaml       # Platform definition (source of truth)
├── icon.png              # Platform icon
├── instructions/         # Setup walkthroughs
│   ├── AWS CLI.md
│   ├── AWS Console.md
│   └── AWS One Click.md
└── exports/              # Downloadable templates (optional)
```

**The `massdriver.yaml` Format**:

Each platform has a declarative `massdriver.yaml` that drives the build process:

```yaml
name: aws-iam-role               # Resource type name
label: AWS IAM Role              # Display name in UI
icon: https://...                # Icon URL

ui:
  connectionOrientation: environmentDefault
  environmentDefaultGroup: credentials
  instructions:                  # References to markdown files
    - label: AWS CLI
      path: ./instructions/AWS CLI.md

exports:                         # Optional: downloadable templates
  - downloadButtonText: Kube Config
    fileFormat: yaml
    templatePath: ./exports/kubeconfig.yaml.liquid
    templateLang: liquid

schema:                          # JSON Schema as YAML
  title: AWS IAM Role
  type: object
  properties:
    # ... credential fields matching your OpenTofu provider auth
```

The `schema` section should match your OpenTofu/Terraform provider authentication configuration. For example, AWS IAM Role credentials match the `aws` provider's `assume_role` block, Azure Service Principal matches the `azurerm` provider config, etc.

**Export Templates** (optional): The `exports/` directory enables self-service artifact downloads. Export templates allow developers to download pre-configured files based on deployed artifact data—like generating a kubeconfig file from a Kubernetes cluster credential, VPN configuration files with certificates, database connection strings, or environment variable files for local development.

Templates use Liquid syntax and have access to the full artifact payload via the `artifact` variable. When a developer clicks the download button in Massdriver's UI, the template is rendered with their specific artifact data and downloaded as a ready-to-use configuration file.

Export configuration is defined in the `massdriver.yaml`:
- `downloadButtonText`: The label shown on the download button
- `fileFormat`: The file extension for the downloaded file
- `templatePath`: Path to the template file (relative to the platform directory)
- `templateLang`: Template language (currently only `liquid` is supported)

**Example template** (`exports/kubeconfig.yaml.liquid`):
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
  - cluster:
      server: {{ artifact.data.authentication.cluster.server }}
      certificate-authority-data: {{ artifact.data.authentication.cluster.certificate-authority-data }}
    name: {{ artifact.id }}
users:
  - name: {{ artifact.id }}
    user:
      token: {{ artifact.data.authentication.user.token }}
```

This template references fields from the deployed artifact's `data` payload, allowing developers to instantly download correctly configured files without manual copy-paste.

> **Note**: The `massdriver.yaml` format used here is a prototype for a more declarative authoring experience that may be adopted in future versions of Massdriver.

**Included platforms**:

- `aws/` - AWS IAM Role authentication
- `azure/` - Azure Service Principal authentication
- `gcp/` - GCP Service Account authentication
- `kubernetes/` - Kubernetes cluster connection

**Extending Massdriver**: Your platform team can support any cloud or SaaS platform by creating a new platform directory and defining its `massdriver.yaml`. Design the `schema` section to match your OpenTofu provider or Helm authentication configuration. Massdriver captures those credential values and securely passes them to your automation workflows.

Update your supported cloud platforms and onboarding instructions with:

```bash
make publish-platforms
```

This compiles the `massdriver.yaml` definitions into `dist.json` artifacts for publishing.

### 📄 `preview.yaml`

**Preview environments** are short-lived environments forked from a base environment (typically `production` or `staging`) so you can stand up a full stack for a pull request, a demo, or a one-off experiment without hand-wiring every instance. Massdriver clones the canvas, then applies the overrides you declare in `preview.yaml` — pinning specific bundle versions, swapping in cheaper instance sizes, scoping secrets, and templating values with environment variables like `${GITHUB_PR}`.

The `preview.yaml` at the repo root is a working example you can adapt:

- **`project` / `baseEnvironment`** — which environment to fork from.
- **`attributes`** — ABAC tags applied to the new environment (lifecycle, branch, region).
- **`environmentDefaults`** — pin shared resources (e.g. a Kubernetes cluster) the preview should reuse instead of cloning.
- **`instances`** — per-instance overrides for `version`, `params`, and `secrets`. Instances listed without overrides inherit from the fork; instances omitted entirely are still cloned from the parent.

Use it from CI (typically a `pull_request` GitHub Action) to fork the environment:

```bash
mass environment preview "pr${GITHUB_PR}" -f preview.yaml
```

Then on PR close, decommission and delete it:

```bash
mass environment decommission "pr${GITHUB_PR}" --follow
mass environment delete "pr${GITHUB_PR}"
```

See the [Preview Environments workflow guide](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/workflows/preview) for the full CLI reference, CI examples, and the complete `preview.yaml` schema.

## Tour of the Demo Bundles & Resource Types

The bundles and resource types ship pre-wired with realistic shapes so you can poke at the UX on the canvas before writing any IaC. Below is a quick map of what's in each one and which `massdriver.yaml` features it showcases — useful when you want to find a working example of `$md.enum`, the `app:` block, conditional `dependencies`, etc.

> [!TIP]
> The IaC under each `bundles/*/src/` is `random_pet`-based stub code so the canvas works end-to-end. **Swap it for your real OpenTofu / Terraform once you've got the schema shape you want** — the `_massdriver_variables.tf` file regenerates from your params + dependencies on every `mass bundle build`, so you can change the schema and your variables stay in sync.

### `network/` bundle ↔ `virtual-network` resource type

Produces a virtual network with subnets that other bundles attach to.

- **`params.examples`**: Small (/24 dev) · Medium (staging) · Large (production multi-AZ) — preset dropdown in the UI.
- **`$md.immutable: true`** on `cidr` — once set, the form blocks edits.
- **`message.pattern`** override on the CIDR pattern (so users see "Must be a valid IPv4 CIDR block, like 10.0.0.0/16" instead of a raw regex).
- **Conditional `dependencies`** block: `flow_log_retention_days` is required only when `enable_flow_logs` is `true`.
- **Array constraints** on `subnets` (`minItems: 1`, `maxItems: 12`, `uniqueItems`) and `dns_servers` (`maxItems: 4`).
- **UI**: `ui:widget: updown` on retention, `ui:help` on every non-obvious field, `ui:options.orderable/addable/removable` on the subnets array.
- **Alarms** (`src/alarms.tf`): `Egress Throughput Anomaly`, `NAT Port Exhaustion`.

### `postgres/` bundle ↔ `postgres-database` resource type

Produces a PostgreSQL instance, depends on a `virtual-network`.

- **Human-readable version selector** via `oneOf` + `const` + `title` (Postgres `12` is labelled "out of community support — upgrade soon"; `16` is labelled "current").
- **`$md.enum`** on `subnet_filter` — populates a dropdown from the linked network's `.subnets`.
- **Multi-annotation combo** on `username`: `$md.immutable: true` + `$md.copyable: false` (won't change post-deploy, won't carry into a cloned env).
- **`$md.sensitive: true`** on the resource-type's `auth.password` (masks the value in the UI and audit-logs every download).
- **T-shirt sizing** (`xs`/`s`/`m`/`l`/`xl`), `allocated_storage_gb` with `multipleOf: 10`, `backup_retention_days` with `minimum`/`maximum`, conditional `multi_az_zones` when `high_availability: true`.
- **Alarms**: `High Connections`, `Storage 80% Full`, and a conditional `Replication Lag` that only emits when HA is on.

### `mysql/` bundle ↔ `mysql-database` resource type

Same shape as `postgres/`, with MySQL-specific touches:

- **`character_set` and `collation`** enums, both `$md.immutable: true`.
- **Conditional `slow_query_log_long_query_time_seconds`** required only when `slow_query_log_enabled: true`.
- **`username` capped at 32 chars** via `maxLength` (MySQL's username limit).
- **Alarms**: conditional `Slow Query Rate`, conditional `Replication Lag`, `Storage 80% Full`.

### `bucket/` bundle ↔ `object-storage` resource type

Object storage. No upstream connections.

- **`access_level`** as `oneOf` with `title` labels ("Private — no anonymous access (recommended)", "Public Read+Write — rarely safe").
- **`object_lock`** marked `$md.immutable: true` (one-way switch) with a `dependencies` block requiring `object_lock_retention_days` and `versioning_enabled` when on.
- **`lifecycle_rules`** array (max 8, unique items) with per-rule transition + storage class enum; UI lets you reorder / add / remove rules.
- **CORS origins** array with origin-URL pattern validation.
- **Alarms**: `5xx Error Rate`, conditional `Anonymous Access Anomaly` (only when the bucket is private).

### `application/` bundle ↔ `workload` resource type

A containerized app that connects to a network + Postgres + (optional) bucket.

- **Full `app:` block** showcasing both halves:
  - **`app.envs`** — JQ expressions that lift connection values into env vars (`DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_URL` via string-concat, `BUCKET_NAME` with `// ""` fallback when no bucket is linked).
  - **`app.secrets`** — declares `JWT_SECRET` (`required: true`), `SENTRY_DSN` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` (optional). The UI blocks deploy until required secrets are set.
- **`$md.enum`** on `database_policy` and `bucket_policy` — populates from the linked resource's `.policies` array.
- **`environment` and `log_level`** as `oneOf` enums with explanatory `title` labels.
- **`cpu_limit`/`memory_limit`** as plain `enum`s modeled on Kubernetes resource strings.
- **`image` regex** that requires `image:tag` or `image@digest` (no implicit `:latest`).
- **Alarms**: `Pod Restart Rate`, `5xx Error Rate`, `p95 Latency`.

### `resource-types/*/instructions/`

Each resource type ships per-source form-fill walkthroughs that render alongside the resource creation form in the Massdriver UI. They tell operators how to harvest each schema field from the matching cloud (`AWS RDS PostgreSQL.md`, `Azure VNet.md`, `GCP Cloud Storage.md`, etc.) or from a self-hosted setup. Same pattern as `platforms/<cloud>/instructions/` — replace or extend with your team's onboarding steps.

> [!NOTE]
> The bundle `src/*.tf` files use the new `massdriver_resource` (the replacement for the deprecated `massdriver_artifact`, gone in provider v2.0) and `massdriver_instance_alarm` resources from `massdriver-cloud/massdriver ~> 2.0`. Reference these when you wire your real cloud resources up.

## Customizing Your Catalog

### Prerequisites

- Self-hosted Massdriver instance running **server v2.0.0 or higher**
- [Massdriver CLI (`mass`)](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/cli) **v2.0.0 or higher**, installed and authenticated
- OpenTofu or Terraform installed (for implementing bundles)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This catalog targets Massdriver v2 (CLI v2 + GraphQL `/v2/`). Check your CLI with `mass version`; the same command also reports the connected server version. If you're still on v1, upgrade both server and CLI before publishing — v2 changed how OCI repositories are managed and v1 publish flows will not work.

> [!TIP]
> **Claude Code Users**: Install the Massdriver Claude Code Plugin for AI-assisted bundle development with built-in guardrails, patterns, and validation rules:
> ```bash
> /plugin marketplace add massdriver-cloud/claude-plugins
> /plugin install massdriver@massdriver-cloud-claude-plugins
> ```

### Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-private-repo-url>
   cd massdriver-catalog
   ```

2. **Update GitHub URLs**

   Replace `YOUR_ORG` with your actual GitHub organization name throughout the repository. This updates `source_url` fields in bundles and links in operator runbooks to point to your repository.

3. **Configure GitHub Secrets and Variables**

   This repository includes GitHub Actions workflows that automatically publish resource types and bundles to your Massdriver instance on push to `main`. To enable this, configure the following in your GitHub repository:

   **Required Secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets):
   - `MASSDRIVER_API_KEY` - Your Massdriver service-account API key. See [Service account permissions](#service-account-permissions) below for the privileges this account needs.

   **Required Variables** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables):
   - `MASSDRIVER_ORG_ID` - Your Massdriver organization ID. You can find this in your Massdriver instance URL or in the organization settings.

   **Optional Variables** (for self-hosted instances):
   - `MASSDRIVER_URL` - The API URL of your self-hosted Massdriver instance (e.g., `https://api.massdriver.yourdomain.com`). If not set, defaults to `https://api.massdriver.cloud`.

   Once configured, any push to the `main` branch will automatically:
   - Ensure each resource type's OCI repository exists, then publish all resource types in `resource-types/` (and any enabled platforms in `platforms/`)
   - Ensure each bundle's OCI repository exists, then build and publish all bundles in `bundles/`

   > [!TIP]
   > To publish snapshot/dev versions on every PR push, enable [`publish-bundles-dev.yml.example`](./.github/workflows/publish-bundles-dev.yml.example) by renaming it. It runs `mass bundle publish --development` against any bundles changed in the PR.

#### OCI repositories

In Massdriver v2, every **bundle and every resource type** (platforms included) is published into its own OCI repository, and **the repository must exist before publish will succeed**. A repository is named exactly after the bundle or resource type it holds, and all repositories share a single namespace — so a bundle and a resource type cannot use the same name.

The CI workflows handle creation automatically — they call `mass repository create <name> -t bundle` (or `-t resource-type`) before each publish and ignore the "already exists" error. Locally, `make create-repos` does the same thing for everything in the catalog.

If a repository needs custom attributes (for example, `-a owner=data,service=database`), the workflow can't infer them. Create those repositories once by hand:

```bash
mass repository create my-bundle -t bundle -a owner=data,service=database
```

After that, normal pushes will keep publishing into the same repo.

#### Service account permissions

The service account behind `MASSDRIVER_API_KEY` needs to be able to:

- **Create OCI repositories** — required for the idempotent `mass repository create` step.
- **Publish to OCI repositories** — required for `mass bundle publish`.
- **Publish resource types** — required for `mass resource-type publish` (used for both `resource-types/` and `platforms/`).

In your Massdriver instance, grant the service account the role(s) that include these permissions before pointing CI at it. If the workflow fails on first run with an authorization error, this is almost always the cause.

#### Publish order on first run

`mass bundle build` resolves every `resource_type:` in `dependencies:` / `resources:` against your Massdriver server, so resource types must already be published before any bundle that references them will build. The default GitHub Actions workflows are split by file path — pushing only `bundles/**` will not trigger the resource-types workflow. On a fresh catalog, run `make publish-resource-types` (or push a change under `resource-types/`) once before publishing bundles, or run `make all` locally to do both in order.

4. **Set up pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

   This will automatically format JSON/YAML, validate Terraform, and check for common issues before each commit.

5. **Explore and customize**
   - Review resource types in `resource-types/`
   - Explore bundle schemas in `bundles/*/massdriver.yaml`

6. **Model your platform**

First publish the template bundles to your organization. After you get a feel for organization your resources in Massdriver, you'll update these modules with your IaC.

```bash
make all
```

- Open the Massdriver UI
- Create **projects** - Logical groupings of infrastructure that can reproduce environments. Examples include application domains ("ecommerce", "api", "billing") or platform infrastructure ("network", "compute platform", "data platform")
- Create **environments** within projects - Named environments ("dev", "staging", "production"), [preview environments](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/preview_environments/overview) ("PR 123"), or regional deployments ("Production US East 1", "US West 2")
- Add bundles to your **canvas** (the visual diagram where you design your architecture) — each placement creates an **instance** of that bundle
- **Connect** instances together—linking resources produced by one bundle to dependencies of another, passing configuration between provisioning pipelines (no copypasta! no brittle scripts!)
- Configure **parameters** to test what the developer experience feels like

7. **Implement infrastructure code**
   - When ready, replace placeholder code in `bundles/*/src/` with your OpenTofu/Terraform
   - Test locally with `tofu init` and `tofu plan` or run rapid infrastructure testing with [`mass bundle publish --development`](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/concepts/versions#rapid-infrastructure-testing)
   - Customize platform definitions to match your provider blocks, then publish them:
     ```bash
     make publish-platforms
     ```
   - Update schemas if your implementation needs different parameters

8. **Publish to Massdriver**

   **Automatic Publishing (Recommended)**: If you've configured GitHub Secrets and Variables (step 3), resource types and bundles are automatically published on push to `main`. Simply push your changes:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

   **Manual Publishing**: Alternatively, you can publish manually using the included Makefile:

   ```bash
   make all
   ```

   This command will:
   - Clean up any previous build artifacts
   - Ensure an OCI repository exists for every resource type and bundle (`make create-repos`)
   - Publish resource types to your Massdriver instance
   - Build all bundles (generates schema JSON files from `massdriver.yaml`)
   - Validate all bundles with OpenTofu, Helm, etc.
   - Publish all bundles to your Massdriver instance using your default `mass` CLI profile

   **Publishing** makes your resource types and bundles available in your Massdriver instance. Once published, you'll see them in the Massdriver UI and can add them to your environment canvases.

## Workflow

This catalog is designed for a three-phase approach: model your architecture, implement the infrastructure code, then continuously improve.

### Phase 1: Architecture Modeling (Now)

1. Use the provided resource types and bundle schemas as-is (no infrastructure code needed yet)
2. Create projects and environments in the Massdriver UI
3. Add bundles to your canvas (creating instances)
4. Connect them by linking resources produced by one bundle to the dependencies of another
5. Configure parameters to test what the developer experience feels like
6. Iterate on resource types and bundle scopes until they feel right

**Goal**: Understand what services you want to offer, how they connect, and what the developer experience should be. You're designing the self-service platform interface _before_ writing any infrastructure code.

**Key insight**: This phase is about discovering the right abstractions. Does it make sense to have separate `postgres` and `mysql` bundles? Should your network bundle produce separate "public subnet" and "private subnet" resources, or one combined "network" resource? The schemas let you explore these questions quickly without committing to implementation details.

**Don't aim for perfection—aim for feedback.** Get a working version in front of your developers and iterate based on their input. The abstractions that make sense on paper often need refinement once developers actually use them. You can always add more bundles, refine parameters, or adjust resource types later. Real developer feedback is more valuable than theoretical perfection.

### Phase 2: Implementation (When Ready)

> [!TIP]
> Check out the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/getting-started/overview) for detailed documentation on bundle and resource type development.

1. Replace placeholder OpenTofu/Terraform in `bundles/*/src/`
2. Test your infrastructure code locally with `tofu plan`
3. Update parameter schemas if your implementation needs different inputs
4. Push to `main` to automatically publish bundles via GitHub Actions, or use `make all` for manual publishing
5. Deploy instances to test environments and validate everything works

**Goal**: Fill in the infrastructure code that matches your architectural model.

**Key benefit**: Because you already validated the architecture and developer experience in Phase 1, you're implementing against a proven design. You know what parameters developers need, what dependencies make sense, and what resources to produce.

### Phase 3: Continuous Improvement

1. Add more bundles as needed
2. Create custom resource types for your organization
3. Refine parameter validation and UI schemas
4. Use [release channels and strategies](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/concepts/versions#release-channels) to automate version distribution and upgrades across environments
5. 👋 Say farewell to ticket ops

## Customization Guide

### Resource Types

[Resource types](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/concepts/resource-types) in `resource-types/` define the contracts between bundles—what data gets passed from one to another. (Massdriver's docs may still link these as "artifact definitions"; that's the v1 name.) See the docs for the complete schema reference.

Customize resource types to:

- **Pass connection info between bundles** - A database bundle outputs hostname, port, credentials. An application bundle receives those as inputs and can connect immediately.
- **Validate data before it's used** - Ensure CIDR blocks are valid IP ranges, database names match naming rules, or ports are in valid ranges. Catch config errors before provisioning.
- **Mark sensitive fields** - Use `$md.sensitive: true` on passwords, API keys, certificates. They get masked in UIs and logs but are available to bundles that need them.

> [!TIP]
> When you standardize what your bundles produce—defining consistent resource type schemas—you can automate compliance and security policies across all resources of that type. This eliminates the brittle copy-paste scripts and custom glue code typically needed to wire infrastructure together, replacing them with validated, reusable contracts.

### Bundle Schemas

Each bundle's `massdriver.yaml` defines the complete contract for that infrastructure component. See the [Bundle YAML Spec](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/guides/bundle-yaml-spec) for the complete schema reference.

- **params**: Input parameters that users configure when deploying (instance sizes, database names, feature flags, etc.). These become variables in your IaC code. They provide extra UI controls and validations not available in most IaC tools.

- **dependencies**: Input resources that this bundle depends on, each naming a resource type and the version range it accepts. For example, a database bundle might depend on a virtual-network resource. Dependencies securely pass data (credentials, IAM policies, endpoints) from one bundle to another during provisioning. These become variables in your IaC code, and Massdriver validates that only compatible resources can be connected.

- **resources**: Output resources that this bundle produces for other bundles to consume, each pinned to the resource type version it emits. For example, a database bundle produces a database resource containing connection details. You populate these from your IaC code with `massdriver_resource`.

- **ui**: UI schema that controls how the configuration form is rendered—field ordering, help text, conditional visibility, custom widgets, etc. This follows the React JSON Schema Form specification.

> [!WARNING]
> Params and dependencies share the same namespace in your IaC code. If you have a param named "database" and a dependency named "database", they will conflict as the same variable (e.g., `variable "database"` in Terraform). Use distinct names to avoid collisions.

Customize these schemas to match your desired developer experience. The schemas define the self-service interface your developers will use, so invest time in making them clear, well-documented, and user-friendly.

### Bundle Implementation

When you're ready to implement the actual infrastructure provisioning, replace the placeholder OpenTofu/Terraform code in `bundles/*/src/`.

**How it works**: Massdriver bundles combine policy as code, IaC, and pipelines into a single deployable unit. They define the interface (inputs/outputs), dependencies, and workflow steps—bringing compliance and security scanning into the bundle itself, instead of maintaining snowflake pipelines scattered across hundreds of repos. Massdriver automatically generates input variables from your params and dependencies, then executes your IaC code with those values.

To implement a bundle:

1. **Keep** the `_massdriver_variables.tf` file - it's auto-generated by `mass bundle build` from your schemas. (Optional: You can stop defining variables directly in OpenTofu/Terraform/Bicep and just define them in `massdriver.yaml`. The build process will generate them.)
2. **Replace** `main.tf` with your infrastructure code
3. **Add** additional `.tf` files as needed (variables.tf, outputs.tf, etc.)
4. **Use** Massdriver-provided variables:
   - [`var.md_metadata`](https://docs.massdriver.cloud/getting-started/using-bundle-metadata#md_metadata-structure) - Massdriver metadata (name prefix, instance ID, environment, default tags, etc.)
5. **Output** resource data that matches your `resources:` declaration (connection details, resource IDs, etc.)

**Example**: If your params schema defines a `database_name` parameter, access it in Terraform as `var.database_name`. If your `dependencies:` block requires a `virtual-network` resource named `net`, access its VPC ID as `var.net.data.infrastructure.vpc_id`.

  - Real-world patterns and techniques

These resources complement this catalog by showing you how to work with bundles once you have them implemented.

### Automation

- 🚀 **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/massdriver-cloud/actions)** - This repository includes pre-configured workflows (using `actions/setup@v6`, the v2-compatible release) that automatically publish resource types and bundles on push to `main`. See the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section for setup instructions.

## Best Practices

### Do ✅

- **Start with modeling**: Use the schemas to plan before implementing
- **Single-purpose bundles**: Keep bundles focused (e.g., `postgres`, not `rds`)
- **Iterate on abstractions**: Refine resource types based on usage
- **Test the developer experience**: Configure bundles in the UI before implementing
- **Version your bundles**: Use semantic versioning for stable releases

### Don't ❌

- **Rush to implementation**: Model your architecture first
- **Create generic bundles**: Be specific about use cases
- **Skip documentation**: Update descriptions and help text
- **Ignore validation**: Use JSON Schema to prevent errors
- **Forget about UI**: Good UX makes adoption easier
